# national-water-plan-dashapp
Interactive Dashboard of Sewage Overflow data in the National Water Plan dataset (2020-2022).

This data is taken and processed from: https://www.water.org.uk/overflows-plan

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second interactive dashboard I have created. I focused my efforts on some improvements over the first dashboard I created (Southern Water sewage):
  * Using more consistent and tidier formatting.
  * Using more advanced callbacks, such as filtering across multiple plots and callbacks affecting other callbacks.
  * Creating a simple navigation menu for accessing multiple pages and improve performance.

In my next dashboard I will focus on improving visuals for a more visually-appealing less grid-like structure.
